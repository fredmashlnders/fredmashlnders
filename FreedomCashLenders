You may be able to get a loan on a credit card through a credit card cash advance. Essentially, a cash advance allows you to withdraw cash from your credit limit. It differs from a bank account withdrawal because you have to pay it back — with interest.

Cash advances are usually offered by banks, ATMs, and payday lenders. While they allow you to get the cash you need quickly, they are also very expensive.

When you take out a cash advance, you’ll likely have to pay a fee that ranges anywhere from 3% and 5% of the cash amount. Not to mention the cash advance APR that is separate from your regular purchase APR, which also doesn’t allow an interest-free grace period.
